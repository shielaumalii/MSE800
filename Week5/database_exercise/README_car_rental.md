**Project Scenario: ABC Car Rental System
ABC Car Rental has been managing its operations manually, which has led to inefficiencies and increased workload for staff. The current manual process involves:
-Handling frequent customer inquiries regarding car availability and booking details.
Managing bookings, including compiling requests, reviewing, and approving them manually.
-Performing administrative tasks such as adding, updating, and deleting records of available cars.
To streamline operations and improve service quality, ABC Car Rental has decided to develop an automated Car Rental Management System. This system will digitize and centralize the booking process, enhance customer interaction, and simplify administrative workflows.
