Project Background and Requirements: ABC Car Rental System
1. Background
ABC Car Rental is a growing company that provides rental cars to individuals and businesses. Until now, the company has managed all its core operations—such as customer inquiries, vehicle bookings, and administrative updates—manually through phone calls, spreadsheets, and paperwork.

-This manual process has resulted in several challenges, including:
-Inefficient handling of customer inquiries
-Time-consuming booking and approval workflows
-Prone-to-error vehicle inventory management
-Lack of real-time updates and customer self-service capabilities

To address these limitations and keep up with growing demand, ABC Car Rental plans to implement an automated Car Rental Management System. The goal is to streamline operations, reduce manual effort, and improve overall customer service.
